ppp (2.4.8-1+1~exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

  The pppd-dns init script and systemd unit have been removed. These were
  intended to restore /etc/resolv.conf to how it was before pppd modified it,
  for example when booting a system after a crash while pppd was running while
  using the 'usepeerdns' option without resolvconf. This functionality has not
  worked in a stable release since Debian Squeeze, released in July 2014.

  If you use 'usepeerdns' I strongly recommend using it with resolvconf, or
  managing pppd with a tool such as NetworkManager instead.

  The usepeerdns functionality has *not* been removed, only the fallback
  mechanism during boot which restores resolv.conf.
