Watch File
==========
There is no watch file in debian/ because upstream uses git but has made
no tags, so there is currently no way to watch upstream changes.

Clang Updates
=============
To build with a different version of clang, just alter the clang version
number contained in the debian/clang file, then update the control file
with:

$ ./debian/rules debian/control
